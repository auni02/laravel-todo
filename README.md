# ASSIGNMENT3

This is a Laravel-based To-Do App project with extended authentication and authorization features based on security principles. This project was developed for **Assignment 1 & 2**.

## üîê Features Implemented

### 1. **User Authentication**
- Registration with validation
- Login with rate limiting (3 failed attempts allowed per minute)
- Secure logout
- Passwords are hashed using **Bcrypt**

### 2. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) via Email**
- On login, a 6-digit code is sent to the user's registered email
- Code must be verified before accessing the dashboard
- MFA code is stored temporarily in the `users` table (`mfa_code`, `mfa_expires_at`)
- Code expires after 5 minutes

### 3. **Rate Limiting**
- Only **3 login attempts** allowed per minute using Laravel's `RateLimiter`
- Helps protect against brute force attacks

### 4. **Password Salting**
- A unique random alphanumeric salt is generated for each user during registration
- Stored in the `salt` column in the `users` table
- Salt is combined with the password before hashing using Bcrypt

### 5. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
- Roles: `Admin` and `User`
- Admins can:
  - View list of all users
  - Deactivate/activate users
  - View all To-Do lists by each user
- Users can:
  - Perform CRUD operations on their own To-Do list
- RBAC tables:
  - `user_roles` (`id`, `user_id`, `role_name`, `description`)
  - `role_permissions` (`id`, `role_id`, `description`)
- Button visibility and access control is based on assigned permissions
